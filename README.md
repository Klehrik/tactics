This was a follow up to my LOWREZ 2021 submission, although I made this in PICO-8 instead.  
There are all the basics of unit moving and attacking, but it never got past that.

The code indentation may be a little weird since I wrote this in Notepad++, where I kept the PICO-8 console style of having indents be one space (thus, I used spaces and tabs interchangably).
